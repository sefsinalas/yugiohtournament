# 🃏 Yu-Gi-Oh! Tournament Manager

Welcome duelist! This hobby project is a light‑weight web app for hosting Swiss‑style Yu‑Gi‑Oh! tournaments. It was created with the help of **Codex**, the AI programming model from OpenAI, and is meant to run completely offline in your browser.

## 🧑‍💻 About Codex

This project was scaffolded with OpenAI's **Codex**. The goal was to see how quickly a functional Yu‑Gi‑Oh! tournament tracker could be produced using AI‑assisted coding. Feel free to fork the repository and customize it for your own local duels or community events.

## 💡 Inspiration

Yu‑Gi‑Oh! has a vibrant competitive scene and running small events can be tricky. This simple manager helps organize pairings, record results and keep everyone on the same page. It's not affiliated with Konami, but it draws inspiration from the fast‑paced energy of official tournaments.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Entry point where you pick which page to visit
- `participants.html` – Manage your list of duelists
- `tournament.html` – Handle pairings, results and the scoreboard
- `instructions.html` – Extra details on how everything works

## 🤝 Contributing
